# Lake-Superior-Chlorophyll

This is an exploratory data analysis of the Chlorophyll-a content of Lake Superior. In this repo I included the cleaned dataset, the html of the EDA, the Python scripts showing how I exported this data, and my write-up communicating my findings. I plan on publishing the dataset for others to analyze.
